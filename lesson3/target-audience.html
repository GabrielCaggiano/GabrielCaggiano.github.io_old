            <h3>The Outdoors Enthusaist</h3>
            <p>
                Every true adventurer is always prepared for the worst, but its always nice to have an idea of the weather when going out for something as extreme as a hike in the mountains or something casual like going to to park.  The outdoor enthusiast needs a quick place to get a glance at the weather.
                <br>
                <br>
                The outdoor enthusiast would most likely cover a range from about 16-40 years old, income from minimum wage to over 80k, they would have experience in knowing what weather is best for their planned activity, and could either be just teenagers chekcing the weather before heading out or a parent chekcing the weather for a family trip.

                Scenarios
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whats the weather supposed to look like in the mountains when we arrive?</li>
                    <li>Will it be raining later?  My friends and I want to go play basketball at the park</li>
                    <li>Whats the forecast this weekend?  I would like to take the kids on a little excursion on Saturday.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>The Event Planner</h3>
            <p>
                Nothing is worse than planning an outdoor wedding just to have it ruined with rain or just bad weather.  The Event Planner needs to know with a surety what the weather will be like and whether(pun) they will need to have a backup plan or just plan to be indoors.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Even Planner would most likely be in the age range of 25-40 , income depends but they could be depending on the event to have an income, they would be educated on maybe wind speeds, precipation, and sunlight forecasts.  They could be a professional event planner that does it full time, or maybe just a parent planning a birhtday party.

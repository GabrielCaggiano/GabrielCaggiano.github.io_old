            <h1>Rule of Thirds</h1>
            <h2>USA Today</h2>

            <p>
              I feel like this site does a good job of exemplifying the rule of thirds, espcecially in this screen shot.  Its not perfectly balnaced, but it has the top third which is a simple header, then the large photo for the middle third (can you spot the moutain lion?), and then the title of the article underneath.  It is pleasant to look at and is a nice simple, easy to look at design.

            <h1>White Space</h1>
            <h2>Aero Precision</h2>
            <a class="site-url" href="https://www.aeroprecisionusa.com/" target="_blank">aeroprecisionusa.com</a>
            <img class="white-space-img" src="rsz_white_space_image.png" alt="example of white space and clean design">
            <p>
              I really like this site and its overall design.  I feel like they have good white space (balck space?) between the elements in the header, and then below the main photo there is a nice space between the photo and the search bar.  If you were to keep scrolling you would see this same clean style all the way down.

            <a class="site-url" href="https://www.priceline.com/?vrid=c229c96eb05456ec0c7064bb4da2f1c3" target="_blank">priceline.com</a>
            <img src="rsz_hicks_law_image.png" alt="example of hicks law">
            <p>
              I feel like priceline is a good example of Hick's Law and presenting enough but not too many choices.  You have the top bar to choose your mode of transportation and then below that you select your exepcted dates of departure and return.  Plenty of choices, but not so many that it is overwhelming.
